        <img src="chameleon.PNG"   width=100 height=100        /><hr/>
       First we will read about it characterstics:-<br/><hr/>
       <ol>
        <lI>Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very extensive, highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues;</lI>
            <lI>Their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout. Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail.</lI>
                <lI> Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.</lI>

    First we will read about its characterstics:-<br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back.   </li>
      <li>There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps.</li>
      <li> Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</li>

    <img src="panad.PNG"   width=150 height=150    /><hr/>
 
    First we will read about its characterstics:-<br/>
    <p>Giant pandas have a distinctive appearance. Their thick black and white fur equips them for life in cool forests. Their white coat with black markings is unique, with black patches round the eyes and ears, black legs, and a black band around the shoulders. And they have cute white tails.</p>

    Now we will make a teddy bear :)<br/>
    <img src="teddy.PNG"   width=150 height=150    /><hr/>
 
    First we will read about its characterstics:-<br/>
    <p>The name teddy bear comes from former United States President Theodore Roosevelt, who was commonly known as "Teddy" (though he loathed being referred to as such).The name originated from an incident on a bear hunting trip in Mississippi in November 1902
        
        Early teddy bears were made to look like real bears, with extended snouts and beady eyes. Modern teddy bears tend to have larger eyes and foreheads and smaller noses, babylike features intended to enhance the toy's "cuteness". Some teddy bears are also designed to represent different species, such as polar bears and brown bears, as well as pandas and koalas.

        While early teddy bears were covered in tawny mohair fur, modern teddy bears are manufactured in a wide variety of commercially available fabrics, most commonly synthetic fur, but also velour, denim, cotton, satin, and canvas.

    Now we will make a dog :)<br/>
    <img src="dog.PNG"   width=150 height=150    /><hr/>
 
    First we will read about it:-<br/>
    <p>  Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses of individuals or groups of domestic dogs to internal and external stimuli.[1] It has been shaped by millennia of contact with humans and their lifestyles. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned in these fellow mammals.  </p>
